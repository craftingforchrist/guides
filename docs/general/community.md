# Community Life

Maintaining a safe, welcoming, and enjoyable community is a top priority for Crafting for Christ. Our rules and guidelines are designed not just to prevent conflict, but to foster an environment where everyone can enjoy the game, collaborate, and grow together.

## Accessing the Rules

You can always access our community rules in-game or online:

* **In-Game:** Type `/rules` at any time to view the full list of guidelines.
* **Online:** Visit our [Rules Page](https://craftingforchrist.net/rules) for the most current and detailed information.

> **Tip:** Rules are updated periodically to reflect new features, server changes, and community feedback. Check the online page regularly to stay informed.

## Key Expectations

To ensure a positive experience for all players, we ask that everyone follows these core expectations:

### 1. Be Kind

* Treat all players with respect, whether in chat, through actions, or while interacting with builds.
* Avoid personal attacks, harassment, or targeting others.
* Encourage new players and celebrate others’ achievements.

### 2. No Griefing

* Respect the creations and claims of other players. Do not destroy, steal from, or tamper with others’ builds without permission.
* If you accidentally damage someone’s build, notify them immediately and help fix it.

### 3. Keep Chat Clean

* Maintain a friendly and safe chat environment.
* Refrain from swearing, inappropriate language, or content that may be offensive to others.
* Use public chat responsibly, and avoid spamming or flooding the chat.

### 4. Solve Problems Peacefully

* Conflicts are natural, but resolving them respectfully is required.
* Attempt to resolve disagreements directly and politely with other players.
* If a resolution cannot be reached, contact a staff member for assistance. Staff are trained to mediate disputes and ensure fairness.

## Additional Guidelines

* **Follow Staff Instructions:** Staff are here to help enforce rules and maintain community safety. Please follow their guidance promptly.
* **Report Issues Responsibly:** Use `/report` or contact staff directly for serious issues. Provide clear, honest information.
* **Be Inclusive:** Crafting for Christ is a community for everyone. Be welcoming and supportive to players of all backgrounds.
