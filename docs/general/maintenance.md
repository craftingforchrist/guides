# Server Restarts & Maintenance

Server restarts and maintenance are essential practices that keep **Crafting for Christ** stable, secure, and enjoyable for everyone. While they may occasionally interrupt gameplay, they protect your progress, improve performance, and allow us to roll out updates safely.

---

## Summary

Regular server restarts and maintenance help to:

* Reduce lag and improve server performance.
* Apply updates, bug fixes, or new features.
* Protect player progress and builds.
* Ensure the server remains secure and reliable.

## Scheduled Restarts

Scheduled restarts are planned in advance and announced clearly in-game and on the server website.

**Key points:**

* A **countdown** appears before each restart to give players time to finish activities.
* These usually happen during **low-activity hours** to minimize disruption.
* Scheduled restarts may also coincide with **maintenance periods**.

**Tips for scheduled restarts:**

* Log out safely or store valuable items in chests.
* Avoid fighting mobs or performing risky activities.
* Stand in a safe location to prevent accidental loss of health or resources.

## Emergency Restarts

Emergency restarts occur when urgent server issues require immediate attention.

**Key points:**

* Rare but necessary to fix critical problems or apply urgent updates.
* Players are usually notified through in-game announcements or Discord.
* Your **inventory, location, and builds are safe**, but sudden restarts may interrupt gameplay.

## Server Maintenance

Maintenance refers to planned or emergency periods where the server may be **offline or limited** for updates, backups, or improvements.

**What happens during maintenance:**

* Updates or bug fixes are applied.
* Server performance is optimized.
* Backups are created to ensure player data is secure.
* New features or events may be introduced.

**Tips for maintenance periods:**

* Check announcements for scheduled maintenance times.
* Plan your gameplay around maintenance windows.
* Ensure valuable items or in-progress builds are safely stored.

## Player Safety Recommendations

Even though the server automatically saves player progress:
