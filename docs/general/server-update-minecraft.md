# Why Doesn't the Server Update Immediately After a Minecraft Update?

## Overview  
When Mojang releases a new Minecraft update as drops every 6 months or so, we as the community are often excited to try the new features right away. However, you may notice that our server **doesn’t update instantly**. This is intentional — we wait to update in order to keep the experience smooth, stable, and available to everyone.  

---

## Why the Delay Happens  

### 1. **Compatibility Needs Time**  
When a new Minecraft version is released, many of the tools, systems and integrations that our server relies on — need to be updated as well. Updating too soon could mean:  
- Features break or behave unpredictably  
- Player data or builds could be at risk  

---

### 2. **Features and Integrations Must Be Tested**  
We use a range of features and integrations to make your experience enjoyable. When Minecraft updates, we need time to:  
- Test that everything still works  
- Patch any issues or exploits  
- Make sure the server stays stable and safe  

---

### 3. **Bug Prevention & Player Safety**  
Rushing into a new version could introduce bugs, glitches, or world corruption. Taking extra time allows us to test the update carefully and ensure everything runs smoothly before players join on the new version.  

---

### 4. **Community Stability**  
Waiting briefly allows players time to update their own game clients, waiting for client-side mods to update, so everyone stays on the same version and nobody is locked out or missing out.

## Typical Update Timeline  
How long we wait depends on the type of update:  

- **Small bug-fix releases** (e.g., `1.20.1 → 1.20.2`): Usually within **2-3 weeks**  
- **Major releases** (e.g., `1.20 → 1.21`): We typically wait **up to a month**, sometimes a bit less, depending on how fast everything becomes stable.

## What You Can Do  

- **Be Patient:** We roll out updates as soon as it’s safe  
- **Stay on the Server Version:** Set your Minecraft launcher to match our server version until we update  
- **Follow Announcements:** Check Discord or our website for updates and news.
