# A Survivor's Guide to the Midnight Hold

## The Long Night

Welcome, Survivor. If you're reading this, you've found one of the last bastions against the darkness: a Midnight Hold. Our mission is simple, but far from easy: protect the Core Beacon at all costs. Every night, the creatures of the dark will throw themselves at our defenses in waves, seeking to extinguish the light.

*Your goal is to survive until dawn.* If the Core falls, the night is lost, and so are any rewards for our struggle.

## How to Survive

### Defend the Core
The Core is our lifeline. As it takes damage, its light will dim. You can monitor its health via the boss bar at the top of your screen. To repair it, you'll need Redstone. Right-click the Core with Redstone in hand to mend the damage. But be warned, the Core can only be repaired a few times each night, so make each repair count!

### The Horde
The night will not be easy. The horde attacks in waves, each more ferocious than the last. You'll face a variety of monsters, some with strange and terrifying abilities. Watch out for the mobs, some have special abilities not yet documented. Stay vigilant!

### The Venture
The wilds call to the brave and the foolish. If you must leave the safety of the Hold, you may do so **only during the day** by using the `/venture` command. This will signal your intention to scout the dangerous world outside.

**Be warned:** this is not a decision to be taken lightly. The further you stray, the greater the peril. If you are caught outside when daybreak comes, the consequences will be severe. If you attempt to venture during the day, you will be told how long you must wait until the sun sets and your journey can begin.

### The Spoils of War
Survive the night, and you will be rewarded. At dawn, a crate of supplies will be dropped near the Core. The more waves you and your fellow defenders defeat, the better the rewards will be.

## Survivor's Commands

- `/midnight status`: Check the status of the Core and the current wave.
- `/midnight stats`: Review your personal contributions to the defense.
- `/venture`: Begin a perilous journey into the wilderness (day-time only).
