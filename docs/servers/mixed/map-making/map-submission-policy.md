# Map Submission Policy

## 1. Originality and Permissions
:::warning

All submitted maps must be original works created by you, or you must have explicit written permission from the original creator to use and modify their content.

:::

If you use community assets, templates, or parts of other people’s maps, clearly credit them and ensure you have the right to submit the work.
**Submissions found to use unauthorized or copied content will be rejected.**

## 2. Technical Requirements
* Maps must be fully compatible with Minecraft version 1.8.9.
* While you may build in newer versions, all features and blocks used must be supported in 1.8.9.

Include all necessary files:
* `map.xml` (properly formatted for your server’s map system)
* `Pruned map files` (to reduce file size and remove unnecessary chunks)
* `map.png` (a preview image at 290x246 pixels, showing an overview of the map)

:::info

If you are interested in creating your own `map.xml`, you can find detailed guidance and examples in the official PGM documentation - https://pgm.dev/docs/modules/introduction. 

While we do not require you to make your own XML file—our team can assist with this step.

*Please note: That maps submitted without a completed `map.xml` will take longer to become available for testing if approved, as additional setup will be needed before they can be added to the map pool.*

:::

## 3. Quality and Design Standards
Maps should be well-designed, balanced, and fun to play.

* Avoid overly repetitive or generic themes. Strive for creativity and uniqueness in both layout and aesthetics.
* Ensure both sides of the map are symmetrical and fair for all teams in team-based modes.
* Focus on gameplay experience: Provide enough space for PvP, cover for ranged combat, and clear objectives.
* Avoid overly complex or confusing layouts that could frustrate players or disrupt the flow of the game.

**Maps that do not meet these standards will be returned for revision or rejected.**

## 4. Feedback and Updates
Be open to feedback from the community and server staff.
If changes are requested, work with the team to improve your map.
Inactive submissions or authors who do not respond to feedback may have their maps closed or removed from consideration.

## 5. Submission Process
Submit your map through the official repository (e.g., GitHub).

:::info

When attaching and collating all the necessary files, we recomend reading "Packaging and Releasing" from the PGM documentation site.
> https://pgm.dev/docs/guides/preparing/packaging-and-releasing

:::

* Create a new issue using the provided template.
* Fill out all required information, including a description of the map, intended game mode, and any special features.
* Attach all necessary files (map.xml, pruned files, map.png).

Follow the instructions in the repository’s documentation for a smooth submission experience.

## 6. Rejection and Reconsideration
Maps may be rejected for not meeting the above criteria.
You will receive feedback explaining the reason for rejection and suggestions for improvement.
You may revise and resubmit your map after addressing the feedback.
