# Map Making Guide

## Getting Started
Build your map in Minecraft 1.8.9, preferably in a flat or void world.

This makes construction easier and ensures compatibility.
Use tools like WorldEdit and VoxelSniper to speed up building, especially for large or detailed terrain.

Start with a small-scale sketch or prototype to plan your layout before committing to a full build.

### What is PGM?

PGM is the Minecraft server plugin we use to operate Mixed, it is designed to automate and manage competitive PvP matches with minimal manual intervention.

### What is the map.xml and why is it important?

Every map requires a `map.xml` file, which contains all the configuration for the map’s gameplay, objectives, spawn points, teams, regions, and other features. This XML file is what PGM reads when loading a map, and it determines how the game is played, how objectives are defined, and how the map is managed during the match.

## Map Layout and Design
Focus on creating a fun, balanced, and visually appealing map.

* **Symmetry is key for team-based modes.** Use WorldEdit to copy and flip sections for perfect balance.
* **Provide plenty of flat space for PvP and cover for bow combat.** Mix in different elevations and obstacles to add variety, but keep the main combat areas accessible.
* **Place objectives (wool, monuments, etc.) thoughtfully.** Consider how players will attack and defend these areas, and avoid making them too easy or too difficult to reach.
* **Avoid overly small islands or large gaps between islands.** These can lead to frustrating gameplay, especially for less experienced builders or bridgers.

Test your map with friends or in single-player mode to get a feel for how it plays and to identify any issues.

## Game Mode Specific Tips

## Destroy the Wool (DTW)

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Objective** | Destroy the enemy team’s wool. The first team to destroy 10 wool blocks wins. |
| **Layout** | Two team islands, a center island, and optional wool islands. |
| **Tips** | Ensure both sides are identical. Provide multiple routes to the wool for strategic play. |

## Destroy the Monument (DTM)

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Objective** | Destroy the enemy team’s obsidian monument. |
| **Layout** | Similar to DTW, but monuments are often placed in more defensible or hidden locations. |
| **Tips** | Include secret passages or tunnels for sneaky attacks. Keep the map size moderate. |

## Capture the Wool (CTW)

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Objective** | Steal the enemy team’s wool and return it to your base. |
| **Layout** | More land mass and multiple paths for easy traversal. Wool rooms regioned for enemy access. |
| **Tips** | Make it challenging but not impossible for attackers to break through defenses. Avoid mining into wool rooms. |

## Infected

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Objective** | Humans hide from infected players. |
| **Layout** | Connected areas with plenty of hiding spots and open spaces for PvP. |
| **Tips** | Include cleverly hidden areas, but avoid making them impossible to find. Use redstone for secret doors if possible. |

## Blitz

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Objective** | Team deathmatch with no respawns. |
| **Layout** | Flat, open spaces for PvP with some cover for ranged combat. |
| **Tips** | Avoid tall grass or double grass, as it can block hits. Keep the map small to medium. |

## General Tips

* **Avoid disruptive blocks:** Use slime, end portals, lava, and water sparingly. Never use barriers in maps where players can build.
* **Use beacons near objectives:** Helps players locate their goals easily.
* **Keep team colors distinct:** Avoid similar colors like green and lime.
* **Test your map:** Play it yourself and with others to identify any issues or imbalances.
* **Collaborate with others:** Working in a team can make map creation more fun and efficient, but make sure everyone is on the same page.

## Special Items and Features

* **Place special items thoughtfully:** Make them accessible but not overpowered. Avoid hiding them in cryptic locations.
* **Avoid unbreakable walls and overly cryptic hiding spots:** Use bedrock for unbreakable walls if needed, and keep hiding spots challenging but not impossible to find.

## Exclusive Game Modes
These modes are set by staff and have unique requirements:

* No building or breaking blocks: Design maps accordingly.
* Focus on the specific gameplay needs of each mode (e.g., hiding spots for Infected, open spaces for Blitz, obstacle courses for Runner).
