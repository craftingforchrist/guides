# Mixed

A place for strategic gameplay, teamwork, and friendly competition.

Our goal is to offer a less toxic, more enjoyable PvP experience. Whether you’re a seasoned fighter or just want to have fun with friends, Mixed focuses on objective-based game modes that promote collaboration, smart plays, and shared victories.

We value community — this is a space built for players who want to grow their skills, work as a team, and build friendships along the way.

## What Makes Mixed Unique?

* **Objective-Based Modes** – Go beyond just fighting; every mode has a goal that requires coordination.
* **Welcoming Environment** – Competitive without the negativity.
* **Team-Driven Gameplay** – It’s not about being the best player, but the best team.
* **Plenty of Variety** – Different modes, different strategies, endless replayability.

## Gamemodes

Some gamemodes we offer:

### Capture the Wool (CTW)

Two teams face off to steal each other's wool.
Enter the enemy’s base, grab their wool, and return it to your victory monument to win.
You’ll need strategy, defense, and good timing to pull this off.

### 5 Capture Point (5CP)

Control five points across the map in a specific sequence.
If your team holds all five at once, you win instantly.
If time runs out, the team with the most control points wins.
Think fast, rotate well, and hold the line!

### King of the Hill (KoTH)

Multiple control points. No set order.
Hold more points to gain score over time.
The first team to reach the target score wins.
Quick rotations and choosing the right fights matter most here. 

### Capture the Flag (CTF)

Classic flag-based competition.
Enter enemy territory, grab their flag, and return it to your base while protecting your own.
Good communication and timing are key to success.

### Destroy the Monument (DTM)

Break into the enemy’s base and destroy their obsidian monument blocks.
This mode emphasizes team pushes, defense, and coordination.
Community map contributions are welcome!

### Spleef

Outlast your opponents by breaking the ground beneath their feet!
Dig, dodge, and stay on your toes — the last player standing wins.
Simple, fast-paced, and always fun.

### Blitz

Fast-paced PvP where players don’t respawn once eliminated.
Multiple teams can compete, and the last team or player standing wins.
It’s short, intense, and all about smart decisions under pressure.

### Infection

One player starts as the infected.
When they eliminate someone, that player joins the infected team.
The goal: survive as long as possible or spread the infection!
Great for large groups and chaotic fun.

The Mixed PvP Arena isn’t just about winning — it’s about learning, improving, and connecting. Whether you're new or experienced, you’ll find a place here to grow your skills and have a blast with friends.
