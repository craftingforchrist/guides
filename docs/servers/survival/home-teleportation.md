# Homes & Teleportation

Getting around the Survival world can take time, but our **home system** makes it easy to return to your favorite locations quickly and safely. Whether it’s your base, farm, or a hidden build project, homes help you spend less time traveling and more time playing.

---

## What Are Homes?

Homes are **saved teleport locations** that you can set anywhere you have permission to build. This lets you jump back to your base, your mine, or your favorite biome with just a single command — no long walks required.

---

## Key Commands

Here’s how to take full advantage of the home system:

### `/sethome [name]`

Save your current location as a home.

* If you don’t specify a name, it will set your default home.
* You can have some multiple homes, you can set different names like `/sethome base`, `/sethome mine`, `/sethome farm` and if you support the server you can gain more additional homes.

---

### `/home [name]`

Teleport to your home.

* `/home` with no name takes you to your default home.
* `/home base` (or other name) teleports you to that specific home.

---

### `/home bed`

Teleport to the last bed you slept in.

* This is useful if you haven’t set a home yet.
* It only works if your bed still exists in the world.

---

### `/delhome [name]`

Delete a saved home.

* Use this if you no longer need a location or want to free up space for another home.

---

## Multiple Homes

Higher ranks or supporter tiers often unlock **additional homes**. These are perfect for:

* **Mining Outposts:** Save time returning to your favorite branch mine or resource-rich cave.
* **Farms:** Quickly check on crops, mob farms, or automated redstone contraptions.
* **Community Projects:** Easily contribute to shared builds by setting a home nearby.
* **Adventure Spots:** Bookmark cool biomes, structures, or villages you discover.

> **Tip:** Keep track of your homes by naming them clearly (e.g. `/sethome desert_village` or `/sethome spawner`).

## Travel Notes & Strategy

Our server does **not allow direct player-to-player teleportation** (like `/tpa` or `/tpaccept`). This encourages a more immersive, exploration-focused survival experience. This is addressed futher [here](./faq.md)

Here are some ways to travel smart:

* **Plan Your Routes:** Set homes near key resource areas to cut down on back-and-forth trips.
* **Use Warps:** If warps are available, combine them with your homes for even faster access.
* **Build Nether Highways:** The Nether is 8× faster for travel (1 block in the Nether = 8 blocks in the Overworld). Many players build roads or ice boat highways in the Nether to link distant bases.
* **Community Transit Systems:** Some servers have shared rail lines, boats, or portals.

## Best Practices

* **Set a Home Early:** As soon as you find a spot to build, use `/sethome` so you don’t lose it.
* **Avoid Overwriting by Mistake:** Always name your homes if you have multiple; setting a new unnamed home will overwrite your default.
* **Keep a Backup Bed:** Beds are cheap — having one near your main base and one near your mine can save you time if you die.
* **Coordinate With Friends:** Even though you can’t teleport to them, you can set a home near their base for easy visits (with their permission).
