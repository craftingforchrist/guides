# Homes & Teleportation

Homes allow you to save your favorite locations and return to them quickly — perfect for base locations, farms, mines, and special builds. Mastering the home system will make your survival experience far smoother.

---

## What Are Homes?

A **home** is a saved location that you can teleport back to at any time. Homes are unique to you and remain saved even if you log out or the server restarts.

---

## Key Commands

Here are the commands you’ll use most often:

* **`/sethome [name]`** – Saves your current location as a home.

  * Example: `/sethome base`
  * You can give your home a custom name (like `farm`, `mine`, or `village`).

* **`/home [name]`** – Teleports you to the named home.

  * If you only have one home, you can simply type `/home`.

* **`/home bed`** – Teleports you to the last bed you slept in.

  * Perfect if you lose track of your base but still have a bed spawn set.

* **`/delhome [name]`** – Removes a saved home you no longer need.

## Multiple Homes

If your rank allows it, you can set **multiple homes**. This is extremely useful for:

* **Mining Trips:** Save a home deep underground to return quickly.
* **Farms & Animal Pens:** Jump back to your crops or breeding areas.
* **Exploration:** Mark interesting structures, villages, or biomes.

> **Tip:** Keep your home names simple and memorable so you don’t forget them later.

## Travel Strategy

* **Plan Ahead:** There is **no player-to-player teleportation** (like `/tpa`). Coordinate with friends and set homes near each other if you plan to work together.
* **Use the Nether:** Build Nether portals to connect distant bases with fast travel highways.
* **Set Multiple Checkpoints:** If traveling far, set temporary homes along the way to make returning easier.

# Warps & World Navigation

Warps let you move instantly between major areas of the server. Understanding how to use warps will save you a lot of time traveling across the world.

---

## What Are Warps?

Warps are **server-designated teleport points** that take you to key locations. They’re great for quickly reaching shops, community areas, and major roads leading out of spawn.

---

## Warp Types

### Walk-In Banner Warps

In many areas, you’ll see **banner portals**. Simply walk through them, and you’ll be teleported to the corresponding location.

---

### Cardinal Direction Warps

Spawn typically has **North, South, East, and West exits**, marked with signs or banners. These take you a set distance away from spawn, ideal for starting a base far enough out to avoid crowded areas.

---

### Shopping District Warp

Use this warp to visit the **economy hub** where you can buy and sell goods, visit player shops, and interact with the server’s economy.

---

## Navigation Tips

* **Build Near a Warp:** This makes travel to and from spawn and shops much easier.
* **Use Warps for Resource Gathering:** Many servers have warp points to special mining or farming areas.
* **Combine Warps with Homes:** Set a home near your favorite warp for quick access to highways or community builds.
