# Frequently Asked Questions

# Why doesn't the Server have TPA, why won't it be enabled?
Our goal has always been for more community focus on things like our warps via Spawn and our Nether highway. 
Together as an administrative team we've decided to not implement TPA and instead recommend that players use the Nether Highway and have your portal set-up, or you can use the warps at Spawn.

You can also suggest to setup permanent warp points by opening a ticket on our Discord (https://craftingforchrist.net/discord) and we can look into this.
