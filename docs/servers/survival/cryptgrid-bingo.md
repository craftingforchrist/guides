# CryptGrid Bingo

Every month, the community will be taking on a 5√ó5 Bingo card of survival challenges, but all of the objectives are hidden and scattered with hints! Work together to reveal the board, race to be first on objectives, and climb the leaderboard!

## üìö Volumes & Themes

Each month is released as a new **Volume**:

* **Title & Theme:** Every Volume has a unique title, and sometimes a special theme (e.g., farming focus, combat-heavy, exploration adventures).
* **Fresh Start:** On the **1st of each month**, a new Volume begins with **25 fresh objectives**.
* **Community Driven:** Players can suggest new challenge ideas for upcoming Volumes in **`#survival-bingo-suggestions`** on Discord.

## üìÖ About the Event

* **Shared Card:** The entire community plays on one Bingo card.
* **Community Reveal:** When any player completes an objective, that square is revealed for everyone.
* **Individual Progress:**

  * Only the **first player** to complete/discover an objective earns the points for it.
* **Bonuses:** Extra points are awarded for completing rows, columns, diagonals, and the full card.

## üß© Hint Reveals

To keep things exciting, **hints** unlock every few days:

* **Where:** Viewable in the **/bingo card**.
* **What:** Hints give partial clues toward objectives (e.g., item type, biome hint, activity category).
