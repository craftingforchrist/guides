# CryptGrid Bingo

![cryptgrid logo](./img/cryptgrid-logo.png)

**CryptGrid Bingo** is a recurring community survival challenge played on a 5√ó5 board of hidden objectives. Play to **reveal** the board, **race** to discover objectives first, and **score points** to climb the leaderboard.

## üîÑ How Each Volume Works

* **New Volume, New Board**: Each event runs as a **Volume** with configured **start/end dates** (we typically run one per month). When a Volume begins, you get **25 fresh, hidden objectives** on a 5√ó5 card.
* **Theme & Variety**: Volumes can lean into different styles‚Äî**farming**, **combat**, **exploration**, crafting, or quirky twists.
* **Community Ideas**: Suggest future challenges in **`#survival-bingo-suggestions`** on Discord.

## üßÆ Scoring & Bonuses

* **Objective Points (everyone):** When you complete an objective, **you** earn its **points**, even if someone else did it earlier.
* **Discovery Bonus (first only):** If the objective was still hidden, the **first player to complete it** also gets a small **discovery bonus**.
* **Line & Full-Card Bonuses (per player):** Earn **extra points** for finishing **rows, columns, diagonals**, and your **full card**.

---

## üß© How Objectives Reveal

* **By Discovery:** When **any player** completes a hidden objective, that square is **revealed for everyone** (in Shared Card mode) and its clue becomes visible.
* **By Time (automatic hints):** Some hints unlock on a **timer** during the Volume to guide you toward unrevealed squares.
