# Death & Graves

Death is a natural part of survival gameplay, but losing your hard-earned items doesn’t have to be permanent. Our server uses a **grave system** to keep your belongings safe and give you a chance to recover them after death. This guide will walk you through how graves work, how to retrieve your items, and tips to make recovery easier.

## What Happens When You Die

When you die, instead of your items scattering all over the ground, they are stored securely in a **grave** placed at the location of your death.
This grave contains everything you had on you at the time of death — your inventory, armor, and off-hand item — so nothing is lost.

## How to Recover Your Items

Follow these steps to get your items back:

1. **Return to the Location of Your Death**

   * If you are far away, write down your death coordinates (shown in chat when you die) so you can find the grave later.
   * You can travel by foot, elytra, or by using your home and warp commands strategically.

2. **Right-Click the Grave**

   * Once you are standing near your grave, right-click it (if you shift right click you will have your items back where you left them).
   * Your items will be instantly returned to your inventory, just as they were before you died.

## Time Limit for Graves

Graves will remain at your death location for **3 hours**. After this time, the grave will **despawn** permanently, and your items will be lost.
Make sure to retrieve your grave as soon as possible — especially if you are far away from home.
