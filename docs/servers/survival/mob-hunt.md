# Mob Hunt

Sharpen your sword and stock up on potions. **Mob Hunt** is a server-wide event of challenge where every mob you defeat brings you closer to the top of the leaderboard!

The hunter with the most points when the event ends, will earn the **Mob Hunter** cosmetic rank for the rest of **2025** and all the way through **2026** – until someone new rises to challenge you in next year’s Mob Hunt.

## Joining the Adventure

When you first log in, type `/mobhelp` in chat.  
This explains any extra rules, bonus mobs, or special surprises for this year’s hunt. Think of it as your quest scroll: read it so you don’t miss anything important.

Once you’re ready to start hunting, just play as normal – but now every mob you fight can help you climb the ranks. You’re not just surviving the night; you’re racing other players for the top spot.

If you want to see how your journey is going, use `/mobstats`. This will show you which mobs you’ve hunted, how many you’ve killed, and how many points they’ve earned you. It’s like your personal hunter’s logbook, tracking your progress as you roam the world.

On the side of your screen, you’ll usually see a live Mob Hunt scoreboard. It updates in real time as you earn points, so you can watch yourself climb (or drop!) on the leaderboard. If you ever want less clutter on your screen, you can type `/mobscoreboard` to hide it, and the same command again to bring it back.

## The Scoring Challenge

Every mob type in the game is worth a different amount of points. Weaker and common mobs give fewer points, while tougher or rarer mobs give more.

There’s also a system called a **kill cap**. This means that for each mob type, you only get full points for a certain number of kills. At the start, every kill is worth its full value. But as you get closer to that mob’s kill cap, each new kill gives fewer and fewer points.

To stay ahead, you need to move around, explore different areas, and hunt a variety of creatures. Smart hunters switch targets before their points drop too low and always look for new challenges.

## The Prize
At the end of the Mob Hunt event, the player with the highest score becomes the **Mob Hunter**. This is a special cosmetic rank that shows up next to your name.

You keep this Mob Hunter rank:

- For the rest of **2025**, and  
- Through **2026**, until the next Mob Hunt challenges your title.

When Mob Hunt 2026 arrives, everyone will be trying to take that rank from you. Until then, you’re the reigning champion, and that’s something all players will see every time you log in.

## Your Quest Starts Now

The Mob Hunt is more than just killing mobs. It’s a race, an adventure, and a test of skill and strategy. You’ll explore, fight, adapt, and chase bigger and better mobs as you try to stay ahead of everyone else.

Use `/mobhelp` to learn the basics, `/mobstats` to track your progress.  
Hunt smart, be brave, and maybe you’ll be the one wearing the **Mob Hunter** title all the way into 2026.
