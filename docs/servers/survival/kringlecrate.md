## 🎄 A Season for Giving

This event reminds us of the heart of Christmas—God’s perfect gift to the world. Christ came to serve and give freely, and we follow His example as we bless one another with kindness and generosity.

“It is more blessed to give than to receive.” – Acts 20:35

Merry Christmas — and happy gifting! 🎁✨
