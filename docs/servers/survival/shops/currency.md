# Introduction to Currency
In the Economy Update on our Survival Server, we've introduced a shop/economy system that empowers players to establish shops and engage in the exchange of goods and services.

Our server employs Diamonds as the primary currency. The system operates on a straightforward 1-to-1 basis, where 1 Diamond is equivalent to 1 dollar.

## Obtaining Currency
To acquire currency for use in the economy, follow these steps:

* **Find Diamonds:** Your first task is to locate Diamonds in the game world and mine them.

* **Sell Diamonds:** Once you've gathered Diamonds, use the command `/sell Diamond` or `/sell hand`. You'll receive a notification confirming that your balance has been updated with the corresponding amount.

## üõ† Player-Run Economy

This is a true survival economy, meaning:

* All currency is earned in-game (mining, farming, trading).
* No one can buy currency or items with real money.
* Prices are set by players, not the server.

This keeps the economy balanced and ensures fair play for everyone.

## üìè Fair Play & Etiquette

To keep trading fun and fair:
* Respect Shops: Don‚Äôt block or grief shops in the Shopping District.
* Avoid Price Gouging: You‚Äôre free to set your own prices, but reasonable pricing keeps the economy healthy.
* Be Honest: Don‚Äôt scam other players in direct trades ‚Äî scams may be punishable by staff action.

## Exchanging Diamonds
You may find that you want to obtain your Diamonds back from your balance to use. To do this you will need to go to spawn. From there you can find an Admin Shop setup where you can buy back Diamonds from your balance.

This system ensures a vibrant player-driven economy on our server, allowing you to both earn and spend Diamonds for various in-game activities. Enjoy your time on the server and make the most of this exciting new feature!
