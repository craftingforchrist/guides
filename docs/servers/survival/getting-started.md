# Getting Started in Survival

Survival is the most popular server on our Network, a world where players gather resources, build impressive bases, explore far and wide, and work together to create thriving communities. Whether you are completely new to Minecraft or a seasoned builder, this guide will help you take your first steps confidently.

## What Is Survival Mode?

Our Survival world is a **player-driven experience** where you gather resources, craft tools, build structures, fight mobs, and trade with others. Unlike creative mode, every block you place is earned through exploration and hard work, making every project uniquely rewarding.

## Your First Steps

When you first join, you’ll spawn in the **central hub area**, where you can find information, warps, and useful commands. From there:

### 1. Leave Spawn

Follow the **clearly marked paths** out of spawn or use the banners to safely warp you away from spawn. These lead you safely away from protected areas so you can begin your adventure.

### 2. Find a Good Area to Build

Look for a spot that’s:

* **Near a warp or road** for easy travel back to shops, spawn, or friends.
* **Far enough from others’ builds** to respect their space and allow you room to grow.
* **In a biome you enjoy** — forests, plains, mountains, or deserts can all be great homes depending on your style.

### 3. Gather Resources

Start by collecting the basics:

* **Wood:** Punch trees and craft a crafting table, sticks, and wooden tools.
* **Stone:** Mine cobblestone for stronger tools and a furnace.
* **Coal or Charcoal:** Make torches to light up your shelter and prevent mob spawns.
* **Food:** Hunt animals, gather crops, or craft a farm early on to stay fed.

### 4. Build Your First Shelter

Before night falls, make a safe place to stay:

* Dig into a hill, build a small hut, or craft a simple starter house.
* Light it up with torches to keep hostile mobs out.
* Place your bed so you can set your spawn point and skip the night.

## Survival Etiquette

To keep our world friendly and welcoming:

* **Respect other players’ builds** — no griefing, stealing, or trespassing.
* **Keep chat clean and kind** — we want a family-friendly community.
